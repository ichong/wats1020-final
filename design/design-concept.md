#Design Concept
>I want to make a webpage for a coffee shop chain in Seattle with mapbox for the locations of the shops and a data form for those that want to submit feedback or contact the owner. The bottom of the page will have photos and descriptions sliding left and right with features of the shop (baked items, expresso, free wifi, etc). The mobile version will have a toggle at the top right that will drop down the tabs that are on the desktop (contact, about, home) and the photos, map and description will go vertical. 

###Third Party Libraries
>I plan on using Leaflet.js for the map of the different locations of the cafe. jQuery mainly to hide/view details on the page and Bootstrap to assist with the design (maybe use carousel).
